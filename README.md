# Flask-web application

A flask web app with a SQLAlchemy database and login/sign up functions 

The app takes in values from the unique user and generates a stock like candlestick chart based on that data with an Apexcharts script template

Mainly the design is done with bootstrap and some CSS to make the chart look better on phones

Used to be deployed on www.stockbar.ee with PythonAnywhere

Dependencies needed
```
pip install flask flask-login flask-sqlalchemy bcrypt
```
